I'm primarily a web developer and designer, though I've got some background in other areas of software.

I'm a recent father; expect to see some stuff about that sometimes.

I'm a deep numberphile; if it wasn't so expensive I might go back to school for a math degree. I believe firmly in the teachings of [the Tau Manifesto](http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto).

I have a love for formal philosophy and general deep thinking, though politics often turns my stomach; I'm far more interested in the philosophy of technology, mind, science, morality, and religion. Expect to see some of that from time to time.

I post random snippets and not-even-half-finished projects on [GitHub](http://github.com/{{site.github_username}}). Here's a few I'm somewhat proud of (perhaps this list will grow over time):
  
  - [Processing experiments](http://kenbellows.github.io/processing-experiments/): some experimentation with Processing JS ([demo](http://kenbellows.github.io/processing-experiments/))
  - [book](https://github.com/kenbellows/book): A little ruby package to stitch together a book (or large document) from a directory tree containing separate sections in independent files
  - [packet-knife](https://github.com/kenbellows/packet-knife) - final project for an Intro to Ethical Hacking grad course; uses Python and the Scapy package to filter through live traffic or PCAP files and look for site credentials and session cookies sent in the clear
